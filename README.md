SmartAttend | Attendance Tracker
SmartAttend  is an intuitive and feature-rich attendance tracking application designed to help students effortlessly monitor and manage their academic attendance. With a clean UI, powerful analytics, and user-centric features, staying on top of your attendance has never been easier.
NOTE: 🤖 AI Collaboration: This project was co-developed with AI assistance (Google Gemini). I designed the concept, features, and workflows while Gemini generated base code that I refined, debugged, and customized.
